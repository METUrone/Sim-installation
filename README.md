# Sim-installation

We are using only simulations because of COVID-19. For that purpose, we prepared a document for installing mavros, PX4, and gazebo. Then we are giving a way for installing them on a clean Ubuntu 18.04, then using these for controlling a drone on Gazebo with a ROS node, using Mavlink.
